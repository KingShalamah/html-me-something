	 Music has been a significant part of my life for many years. Music is great for entertainment, relaxation, and can even be therapeutic.<br />
	 Growing up, I was exposed
	 to various genres and artists, which gave me an ear for that real old school music
	 sound, but I like some <br />
	 of the new artists too, if they actually sing, play, and / or produce real music.
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 Influenced by both of my parents, but especially my dad when it came to music, I 
	 eventually taught myself how to compose and <br />create music on the keyboard / piano.
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 This enhanced my ability to understand and use music theory for other instruments, 
	 such as the Alto and Tenor Saxophone.
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 Presently, I am proficient in both the Alto and Tenor Sax, basic to intermediate music theory and harmony, and songwriting.
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 Here are a couple of videos of songs I wrote, performed, and produced.<br />
	 The first song in this list I thought would be kind of funny, so when it came to
	 me, I just wrote it and recorded it.<br />
	 </p>
	 
	 <div class="album">
	  <b>Album Title:</b> <em>Rhythm And Smooth</em><br />
	 </div>
	 
	 <div id="song">
	  <b>Bonus Track:</b> <em>Bootleg Man</em>
	 </div>
	 
	</div>

	 <p>Now this next song, <em>Oooh!</em> was a little bit different. <br />
	 We could say that I had a little inspiration for this one. :-)<br />
	 </p>
	 
	 <div id="song">
	  <b>Track Title:</b> <em>Oooh!</em>
	 </div>
	 
	 <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OnKDqFHWUFw" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
	 
	 <p>The last song I will mention for now, is called <em>Satin Jazz</em>.<br />
	 If you like to just chill out and listen to smooth instrumental jazz, then this
	 song is for you.<br />
	 </p>

	 <h1>The Reason I Became Interested In Computers</h1>
	 </center>
	</header>
	
	 <p>
	 For a while, I knew absolutely nothing about computers. As a matter of fact, I did not even have an email address until the<br />
	 autumn season of 2005, and I rarely, if ever used it.
	 
	 However, one day while walking through Best Buy, in the musical<br />
	 instrument section, I saw some computer software that claimed to be able to help musicians create music.</p>
	 
	 <p>
	 Ever since that day, my interest in computers has grown continuously, to include:
	 </p>
	 
	 <ul>
	 <li>Buying and using music software</li>
	 <li>Composing and recording songs from scratch, not sampling beats</li>
	 <li>Learning web programming such as PHP / MySQL (self taught) - I joined Launch Code for formal help, so I can keep what hair I have left :-)</li>
	 <li>Other topics which dive further into the internet</li>
	 </ul>

	 <h1>Friends Once Laughed, Now They Can't Keep Up</h1>
	 </center>
	</header>
	 
	 <p>Some of my friends used to laugh or sound surprised because I did not even
	 have an email address until the autumn or winter season of 2005.<br />
	 
	 Plus, I did not even know how to unzip a file on Windows. 
	 That was back in the days when you had to buy a special piece of software just<br />
	 to unzip compressed zip files.
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 However, once I built a simple, but working miniature social network in PHP and MySQL,
	 without any formal training, they were no longer<br />
	 laughing, though some of them had degrees in the IT field.
	 </p>
	 
	 <p>
	 That's why I believe anyone who truly desires to learn
	 a new skill should go for it.<br />
	 
	 That's why I love LaunchCode, because they are helping
	 me and several others to do just that!
